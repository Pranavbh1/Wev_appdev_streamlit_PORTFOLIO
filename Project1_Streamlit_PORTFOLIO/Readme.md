# Web Application Decelopment using Python Programming Language
# By using STREAMLIT
* Basic setup :
   1. Creation of Virtual Environment :
      > python -m venv name_of env

   2. Activating the Virtual environment :
      > name_of_venv\Scripts\activate            #Deactivate

   3. Install Streamlit :
      >(venv)>pip install streamlit

   4. Create the Project_name folder and App.py(File which used to run all the other files in Project_name folder)
      >VScode
